# Task 4

# Use the interactive help system to display a list of available language “keywords”,
# then quit the interactive help to return back to the Python interpreter.
# Hint: always look for the presence of the input prompt ‘>>>’ to determine
# whether the Python interpreter is ready to accept commands

# Output:

# help("keywords")
#
# Here is a list of the Python keywords.  Enter any keyword to get more help.
